# Typewriter

HTML-based typewriter simulator.

## Files in this repository
- `index.html`: Original version of the simulator. This is unchanged from your previous setup.
- `optimized.html`: A new, faster variant that keeps layout and cursor behavior the same while reducing DOM work. Open this file in your browser to try the optimized experience.
- Sound assets (`type.wav`, `enter.wav`, `nokey.wav`, `Ding.wav`, `paper out.wav`) and sample images are in the repository root.

## How to view the pages
- **Locally:** Download or clone this repository, then double-click `index.html` or `optimized.html` to open them in your browser. No build step is required.
- **From this environment:** The files live at `/workspace/typewriter/index.html` and `/workspace/typewriter/optimized.html`. You can download them (or the whole repo) with `git clone` from your Git hosting service or by using your IDE/editor's download feature.

Both HTML files are self-contained, so you can copy either one to another machine and open it directly.
